# Druid and His Circle of Animals
As a druid, collect and empower enough animals to pass the Druid Circle entrance exam.

The game was made over a two day [Kenney Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2021) on [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and [KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) game frameworks.

## How to play
- Animals will **run towards you**. When they reach you, they will stand in a **circle** around you.
- Move your mouse right or left to **rotate the circle** of animals to the right or left.
- If you put **3 gray** animals of the same type next to each other, they will merge into **1 blue** one. **3 blue** next to each other will merge into **1 gold**.
- Collect at least **one golden** animal **of each type** to win.
- Each gathered animal spends one mana. If you run out of mana, you lose.
- Beware of the bears! They will eat your animal instead of joining you.
